# Virtual Pet Game using Canvas

Virtual Pet Game is a simple virtual pet simulation built with Python and Pygame. In this game, you care for your pet on an interactive canvas (the Pygame window), where its hunger and happiness levels are updated in real time.

## Features

- **Interactive Canvas:**  
  The game window serves as a canvas where your pet's image and vital stats (hunger and happiness) are displayed and updated dynamically.

- **Real-Time Simulation:**  
  Watch as your pet's hunger gradually increases and happiness decreases over time, creating a need for constant care.

- **Keyboard Controls:**  
  Interact with your pet using simple keyboard commands:
  - **F Key:** Feed your pet to reduce hunger.
  - **P Key:** Play with your pet to boost happiness.

- **Game Over Conditions:**  
  The game ends if your pet's hunger reaches 100 or its happiness drops to 0, resulting in your pet running away.

## Installation
  You can use your own image. Just change pet_image.jpeg with your file name.
